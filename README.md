API Operations
API is an interface that allows one software to retrieve data or services from another software. In this project, API operations are demonstrated by making examples on various APIs. Axios, a JavaScript library, is used for API operations.

Examples
The examples folder of the project contains examples on different APIs. The examples include retrieving user information via the GitHub API, retrieving weather information via the OpenWeatherMap API, and many more.

For each example, API keys and other required information should be set first. Then, API operations are performed by running the JavaScript code in the index.html file.
